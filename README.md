# Image Gallery using React

Created an Image Gallery using React. The gallery fetch a set of images from api, (limited images to 20), and display them in a user-friendly UI. 
Upon clicking on any photo, the page is redirected to a single image view, where additional information, such as the title and description of the image is shown.

Used React Router Dom to handle navigation between the gallery and single image view
